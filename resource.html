<p id="quote">"The quantity and applications of sensors in smartphones has expanded across a wide range of applications with many new device and applications coming soon (highlight the 'future' sensors/technology in the list). In fact, most consumers are probably not aware of the complexity and quantify of sensors within their phone today. The processing power and never-ending need for handset manufacturers to differentiate and bring additional features and value to consumers been a driving force behind this trend."</p>
