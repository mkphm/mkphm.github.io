			<h2>About me</h2>

    <p>My name is Khue Pham. I'm studying Web Development at Bellevue College.</p>
    <p>I like to build stuff so I hope I make more progress in my coding skills.
      My goal is starting on some personal projects to keep building my portfolio, so that I land a job in the field after I finish my program.
      </p>
<p>I think having a good website is crucial to every business. It does more than just looking good like creating the brand reputation and awareness, turning prospects into customers and keeping customers from coming back. I know myself always go back to shop at a website that creates a good impression on me. This is why I want to become a web developer. I want to create what people are interested in and improve their experience.
