  <h1>Part 1 - Question</h1>
<p><b>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</b></p>
I Have no previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript. The closest that I've gotten to anything related to coding was when I was a teenager, I used to be active on some music and drama forums, I had to use some codes to modify my signature or make my posts looking good. I didn't even know what those are called, I just look at the guide page that the forum had and followed the steps. But now I know they are called BBCode, and it uses the square brackets [ ] surrounding a keyword.
<p><b>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</b></p>
I used a template to build my portfolio. I found it on awesomeopensource.com and it caught my eye. The theme is called Academic by Jekyll. However, I changed the color scheme and added some of my personal touch to the theme to make the website more like me.
<p><b>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</b></p>
The most challenging part of my portfolio is probably everything that has to do with organization and management. Writing the codes is fun for me but the other parts From planning, time management, deciding where things go, to making sure everything is included in the sites. Another challenge I had is making sure all the names of my files are correct. I came across an incident after I hosted my portfolio, some of my links on the main menu ended up not working. I have the same main menu appearing on all the sites, so I had to pull up every single files and edited them. It would be unavoidable if I were more organized next time.
<p><b>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </b></p>
After taking the class, it is like I look at things from a whole new perspective, especially after listening to the guest speaker Ella Mae. I understand why major sites like facebook, instagram, google choose the fonts that they use. I also understand what goes into making a website. For someone who consumes a lot of internet on a daily basis. I have a new appreciation for web developers, and when I come accross an error while browsing, I am more forgiving instead of getting frustrated. I can somewhat distinguish a good website to a bad one. A lot of people I know have their own websites listed on their social media, I can visit to analyze and critique their websites just for fun.
<p><b>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</b></p>
For future students taking the class, I would recommend having good time management will be usefull, they will have an easier time navigate the final projects. Because it includes everything in the entire course. There is quite a lot of work to do in the class, not just for completing assignments, but also learning about coding. I have a hard time with Javascript so I would recommend not to procrastinate and try to do everything last minute. Start each week aware of upcoming assignments and plan schedule accordingly.
